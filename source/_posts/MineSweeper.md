Course work for *Digital Logic Design*. <!-- more --> I resurrected [this](https://github.com/Luke-Skycrawler/Minesweeper) from a folder that must have been untouched for 2 years. You are more than welcome to entertain yourself with it if you had a FPGA. Despite its cringeness, I'm almost proud of that sophomore rookie who finished this within his rations from 11 p.m to 7 a.m. in 4 days. 


Overview of the design:

The randomness is generated with LSFR:

**And the demo:**

<video src="/videos/short_mute.mp4" type='video/mp4' controls='controls' width='100%' height='100%'>
</video>
{% endraw%}
