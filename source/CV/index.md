I'm a senior student at **Zhejiang University**. Currently, I work as a research assistant in CAD & CG Laboratory under Professor [Xu Weiwei](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/weiweixu/weiweixu_en.htm).

- ðŸ”¬My research interest lies roughly in the reign of Computer Graphics and Physical Simulation, but I also seek its intersections with other powerful advancements in theories or methodologies. 

- ðŸ“–I had wandered a bit before settling on my current research interest. My former experience is in computer systems and architecture. I was fortunate enough to represent ZJU in National Computer System Capability Challenge and won 2nd place with my brilliant teammates [@Ziqi Yuan](https://github.com/monikerzju) and [@Xujie Shen](https://github.com/monikerzju). 

- ðŸ“‹I'm working on auto-quantization compiler support based on [taichi](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi) project as joint first author, running against *SIGGRAPH 2022* deadline. 

- ðŸŽ“**I'm looking into opportunities for MS/Ph.D. pursuit.**
