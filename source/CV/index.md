I'm a senior student at Zhejiang University. Currently, I work as a research assistant in CAD & CG Laboratory, advised by Professor [Xu Weiwei](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/weiweixu/weiweixu_en.htm).

My research interest lies roughly in the reign of Computer Graphics and Physical Simulation, but I also seek its intersections with other powerful advancements in theories or methodologies. 

I had wandered a bit before settling on my current research interest. My former experience is in computer systems and architecture. I was fortunate enough to represent ZJU in National Computer System Capability Challenge and won 2nd place with my brilliant teammates [@Ziqi Yuan](https://github.com/monikerzju) and [@Xujie Shen](https://github.com/monikerzju). 

I'm working on auto-quantization compiler support based on taichi (https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi) project, running against SIGGRAPH 2022 deadline. 

**I'm looking into opportunities of MS/Ph.D. pursuit.**
